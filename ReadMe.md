# Minecraft Recipe Mapper

This is a tool for crawling Minecraft and Create Mod recipes and generating a graph of the recipes. It is designed to help visualize recipe dependencies and understand the relationships between different recipes. The tool can be used to identify bottlenecks in the recipe chain and optimize the crafting process.

It is built using MSAGL, Avalonia, and .NET 8.0

## Project goals
 - [] Read Minecraft JSON recipe files
 - [] Read Create JSON recipe files
 - [] Crawl directories to identify recipe files
 - [] enter .ZIP or .JAR files to identify recipe files
 - [] Generate a graph of the recipes
 - [] Visualize the graph using MSAGL
 - [] Allow users to interact with the graph (e.g., zoom, pan, click on nodes)
 - [] Allow users to filter the graph based on various criteria (e.g., recipe type, mod)
 - [] Allow users to search for specific recipes or items in the graph
 - [] Allow users to save and load graphs
 - [] Allow users to customize the appearance of the graph (e.g., colors, fonts)

## Potential Future Goals
 - [] Allow users to export the graph to various formats (e.g., PNG, SVG, PDF)
 - [] Allow users to generate reports based on the graph
 - [] Support for additional Minecraft mods and recipe types
 - [] Provide a command-line interface for advanced users
 - [] Add support for localization and internationalization
 - [] Improve performance and scalability for large recipe sets
 - [] Integrate with other Minecraft modding tools and libraries?
